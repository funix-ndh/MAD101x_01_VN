/*
 * Review how lotto work
 * Let's say we have set A = {0,1,2,3,...,99} and variable x which { x âˆˆ A | x is an integer }
 * When we pick one number from set A => probability to pick exact x is 1/100
 * two numbers need to pick first number from set A (size = 100)
 * => after first number size A remain 99 (reduce by 1)
 * => probability to pick correct is 1/100 * 1/99
 *
 * conclusion:
 *   fact: f(1) = 1/100
 *   f(n) = f(n-1) * 1/(100 - n + 1)
 *
 * lotto game is very hard to win
